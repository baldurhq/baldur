"""Features summary view — 530 Wave 6F.

Admin-only DRF view that wraps the framework-agnostic ``features_summary``
handler. Decorated with ``@extend_schema`` per 530 D6 exception so the
response shape (D9) is fully discoverable through the OpenAPI surface
without bleeding into the OOS #530-3 campaign across the other ~50 views.

When drf-spectacular is not installed the import falls back to an
identity decorator so the view module remains importable in OSS installs
that don't add ``baldur-framework[openapi]``.
